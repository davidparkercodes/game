   - **User Interface (config/ui/)**: HUD layouts, visual themes, font settings, building selection HUD.
   - **Audio System (config/audio/)**: Sound mappings, audio settings, volume controls.
   - **Input Controls (config/input/)**: Key bindings, control settings, accessibility options.
   - **Resources (config/resources/)**: Scene paths, asset paths.
   - **Debug/Development (config/debug/)**: Debug settings, logging configuration, development tools.

2. **Key Features**
   - Visual configuration editors with form-based editors, color pickers, slider controls, toggle switches, and file path browsers.
   - Real-time validation including schema validation, value range validation, cross-reference validation, and error highlighting.
   - Configuration management with import/export, backup and restore, configuration presets, undo/redo functionality, and search/filtering.
   - Developer tools including a JSON view, configuration diff viewer, hot-reload testing, and tooltips.

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - **Technology Stack**: React 18+, Vite, React Router, Material-UI or Ant Design, React Hook Form, Zod or Joi, Monaco Editor, React Query.
   - **Data Management**: File system access, state management, persistence, automatic backups.
   - **User Experience**: Responsive design, dark/light themes, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility compliance, progressive loading.

  - [ ] Install and configure Zod or Joi for schema validation
  - [ ] Create advanced form components with validation rules
  - [ ] Implement value range validation (e.g., volumes 0-1, positive numbers)
  - [ ] Add cross-reference validation (ensuring referenced assets exist)
  - [ ] Build error highlighting with helpful error messages

- [ ] **JSON Editor Integration**
  - [ ] Install and integrate Monaco Editor
  - [ ] Create split view option (form editor + JSON view)
  - [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for JSON
  - [ ] Add JSON validation and error indicators
  - [ ] Synchronize changes between form and JSON views

- [ ] **Save/Export Functionality**

## Success Criteria

1. **Usability**: Non-technical team members can confidently modify game configurations.
2. **Reliability**: Ensure zero data loss with robust backup and validation systems.
3. **Performance**: Fast loading and seamless editing of large configuration sets.
4. **Maintainability**: Maintain a clean, well-documented codebase that's easy to extend.
5. **Integration**: Enable a seamless workflow with existing game development processes.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Validate all user inputs and handle file operations safely.
- **Error Handling**: Manage malformed JSON and file system errors gracefully.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive user guides and developer documentation.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for validation logic and integration tests for file operations.
- **Deployment**: Ensure a simple, straightforward setup process for team members.

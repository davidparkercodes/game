# **Plan: Remove All Hardcoded Building/Enemy Type References**

## **Problem Analysis**

The codebase contains numerous hardcoded building and enemy type strings that violate configuration-driven design principles. This makes it impossible to change building/enemy names without code changes and creates tight coupling between game logic and specific type names.

### **Current Hardcoded References Found:**

#### **Building Types:**

- `basic_tower` - Found in 4 files
- `sniper_tower` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs
- `rapid_tower` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs
- `heavy_tower` - Found in config files (referenced)

#### **Enemy Types:**

- `basic_enemy` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs, MockEnemyStatsProvider.cs
- `fast_enemy` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs, MockEnemyStatsProvider.cs
- `tank_enemy` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs, MockEnemyStatsProvider.cs
- `elite_enemy` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs, MockEnemyStatsProvider.cs
- `boss_enemy` - Found in GameSimRunner.cs, MockEnemyStatsProvider.cs

---

## **Solution Approach**

Instead of changing the actual names, we'll create a **Type Registry System** that allows easy management of all building/enemy types with flexible naming and config-driven discovery.

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Create Type Registry Foundation** üèóÔ∏è ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### **[x] 1.1 Create Building Type Registry**

- [x] Create `BuildingType` value object/enum with:
  - Internal ID (for code reference)
  - Display name (configurable)
  - Config key (what's used in JSON)
- [x] Create `BuildingTypeRegistry` service to manage all building types
- [x] Load building types from config file metadata
- [x] Support for aliases/alternate names

#### **[x] 1.2 Create Enemy Type Registry**

- [x] Create `EnemyType` value object/enum with same pattern
- [x] Create `EnemyTypeRegistry` service
- [x] Load enemy types from config file metadata
- [x] Support for enemy tier/category system

#### **[x] 1.3 Config Schema Enhancement**

- [x] Add `building_types_metadata` section to building-stats.json:

```json
{
  "building_types_metadata": {
    "registry": {
      "BASIC_TOWER": {
        "config_key": "basic_tower",
        "display_name": "Basic Tower",
        "category": "starter"
      },
      "SNIPER_TOWER": {
        "config_key": "sniper_tower",
        "display_name": "Sniper Tower",
        "category": "precision"
      }
    },
    "categories": ["starter", "precision", "rapid", "heavy"]
  }
}
```

- [x] Add similar `enemy_types_metadata` to enemy-stats.json

#### **[x] 1.4 Architectural Cleanup (CRITICAL)** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Move configuration classes from Infrastructure to Application layer (feature-centric)
- [x] Move `BuildingTypeMetadata.cs` to `src/Application/Buildings/Configuration/`
- [x] Move `EnemyTypeMetadata.cs` to `src/Application/Enemies/Configuration/`
- [x] Delete incorrectly placed Infrastructure configuration files
- [x] Update registry services to use correct import paths
- [x] Verify system still works after restructuring
- [x] Follow Domain/Application layer focus (no Infrastructure yet)

**Architectural Issue Identified:** Configuration models were incorrectly placed in Infrastructure layer instead of Application layer with feature-centric organization. This violates clean architecture principles and feature-centric design.

**Achievement Note:** Type Registry Foundation is fully complete with proper architecture! Created BuildingType and EnemyType value objects, registry services, enhanced config schema with metadata, performed architectural cleanup to move configs to feature-centric Application layer organization, and verified the system works perfectly with the existing GameSimRunner. All types are now managed through config-driven registries with flexible categorization and clean architecture.

#### **[x] 1.5 Terminology Cleanup - Replace "Turret" with "Tower"** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Find all occurrences of 'turret'/'Turret'/'TURRET' in codebase
- [x] Replace class names: `GetTurretStatsQuery` ‚Üí `GetTowerStatsQuery`
- [x] Replace handler names: `GetTurretStatsQueryHandler` ‚Üí `GetTowerStatsQueryHandler`
- [x] Replace response names: `TurretStatsResponse` ‚Üí `TowerStatsResponse`
- [x] Replace property names: `TurretType` ‚Üí `TowerType`
- [x] Replace variable names and comments containing "turret"
- [x] Update any file names containing "turret"
- [x] Verify system still builds and works after terminology cleanup

**Terminology Issue:** The codebase uses inconsistent terminology mixing "turret" and "tower" concepts. The game uses "tower" so all code should use "tower" for consistency.

**Achievement Note:** Terminology cleanup is complete! Successfully renamed all classes, files, properties, and references from "turret" to "tower" across Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers. The codebase now uses consistent "tower" terminology throughout, including `GetTowerStatsQuery`, `GetTowerStatsQueryHandler`, `TowerStatsResponse`, `BasicTower`, `SniperTower`, and all related properties. System builds and runs perfectly after the terminology standardization.

- [x] Update scene files to reference correct .cs files
- [x] Update `src/Presentation/Player/Player.cs` - replace remaining turret references
- [x] Update `src/Presentation/UI/Hud.cs` - replace remaining turret references
- [x] Verify all turret references eliminated from entire codebase

**Achievement Note:** Complete turret reference cleanup accomplished! Successfully updated all remaining files including project configuration, documentation (README, stats_system.md, wave_progression.md), config files (sound_config.json), Godot scene files, and C# presentation layer files. Renamed scene files and directories, updated all property names, method names, and UI references. The entire codebase now uses consistent "tower" terminology with zero "turret" references remaining.

    },
    "spawn_patterns": {
      "boss_waves": [8, 16, 24],
      "elite_frequency": 4,
      "tank_frequency": 3,
      "fast_frequency": 2
    },
    "category_progression": {
      "basic": { "min_wave": 1, "spawn_probability": 0.6 },

      "damage_increment_per_wave": 0.33,
      "reward_multiplier_per_wave": 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

**Achievement Note:** Phase 4 is fully complete! Successfully eliminated all hardcoded enemy type strings from GameSimRunner's `GetEnemyTypeForWave()` method. Replaced hardcoded logic with config-driven category-based enemy selection using `EnemyTypeRegistry.GetByCategory()`. Enhanced MockEnemyStatsProvider with EnemyTypeRegistry integration and intelligent fallback strategies. Created comprehensive `wave_progression.json` configuration file with enemy introduction rules, spawn patterns, category progression, and difficulty scaling. The enemy selection system now uses categories ("basic", "fast", "tank", "elite", "boss") instead of hardcoded strings, with robust fallback logic when categories are not found. Zero hardcoded enemy types remain in the enemy spawning logic.

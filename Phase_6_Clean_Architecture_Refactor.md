# Phase 6: Testing & Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step refactoring plan to transform our game codebase into Feature-Centric Clean Architecture with CQRS and Mediator patterns. We'll work feature by feature, building tests as we go, and ensuring each step can be manually tested before proceeding.

### Architecture Goals
- **Domain Layer**: Feature-based pure business logic + shared domain interfaces
- **Application Layer**: CQRS commands/queries with handlers + CQRS foundation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External interfaces, file I/O, data access, DI container
- **Presentation Layer**: Godot-specific UI and Node logic

### Code Standards
- **No Comments**: Code should be self-documenting, no /// <summary> comments
- **Namespace Style**: Use `namespace Game.Feature.Layer;` (semicolon syntax)
- **File Size**: Keep all files under ~200 lines
- **Feature Organization**: Group by feature/domain concept, not technical layer

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
*Comprehensive testing, performance, cleanup*

### 6.1 Test Coverage
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage on Domain
- [ ] Achieve 85%+ test coverage on Application
- [ ] Add integration tests for Infrastructure
- [ ] Add end-to-end feature tests

### 6.2 Performance & Cleanup
- [ ] Remove old `scripts/` directory
- [ ] Update scene references
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Code cleanup (remove comments, fix namespaces)

### 6.3 Final Validation
- [ ] **FULL GAME TEST**: All features working
- [ ] **CQRS TEST**: Commands and queries executing
- [ ] **DI TEST**: All dependencies resolving
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE TEST**: No regressions
- [ ] **CLEAN CODE**: Under 200 lines per file, no comments

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Domain entities and value objects (CQRS handlers)
- CQRS commands and queries (isolated)
- Mediator pattern functionality
- Domain services (with mocked dependencies)

### Integration Tests
- Command/Query execution through mediator
- DI container service resolution
- Infrastructure components with real dependencies
- Feature flows end-to-end

### Manual Tests (After Each Phase)
- Game launches without errors
- CQRS commands execute correctly
- DI container resolves dependencies
- Feature interactions work
- Performance remains acceptable

## Architecture Benefits

### Feature-Centric Organization
- **Vertical Slices**: Each feature contains its own domain, application, and presentation code
- **Reduced Coupling**: Features are independent and loosely coupled
- **Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different features
- **Easier Testing**: Feature boundaries make testing more focused

### CQRS & Mediator Pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: Commands (write) and Queries (read) are separate
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through mediator
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and test individual handlers
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new commands/queries without changing existing code

### Clean Architecture Principles
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification

## Notes
- Each checkbox represents a testable, deployable increment
- Features are organized vertically (domain → application → presentation)
- No comments policy enforces self-documenting code
- File size limit maintains readability and focus
- CQRS pattern enables clear separation of read/write operations
- Mediator pattern reduces coupling between components
- DI container manages all dependencies centrally

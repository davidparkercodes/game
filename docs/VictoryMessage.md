# Victory Message Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a "You Win! :)" message that displays in the center of the screen when the game ends and the boss dies.

## Components Modified

### 1. HUD Scene (`scenes/UI/Hud.tscn`)
- Added `VictoryPanel` with a dark semi-transparent background
- Added `VictoryContainer` centered on screen
- Added `VictoryLabel` with "You Win! :)" text in yellow
- Added `VictorySubLabel` with "All enemies defeated!" text in green

### 2. HUD Class (`src/Presentation/UI/Hud.cs`)
- Added `VictoryPanel`, `VictoryLabel`, and `VictorySubLabel` properties
- Added node references initialization for victory components
- Added `ShowVictoryMessage()` and `HideVictoryMessage()` methods
- Added victory panel to startup validation and logging

### 3. HudManager Class (`src/Presentation/UI/HudManager.cs`)
- Added `ShowVictoryMessage()` and `HideVictoryMessage()` methods
- Added null safety checks for HUD instance

### 4. GameService Class (`src/Infrastructure/Game/Services/GameService.cs`)
- Added `IsVictory` property to track victory state
- Updated `IsGameWon()` method to return victory state
- Added `MarkGameAsWon()` method to set victory state and show message
- Updated `Reset()` method to clear victory state and hide message

### 5. WaveManager Class (`src/Infrastructure/Waves/Services/WaveManager.cs`)
- Updated `OnAllWavesCompleted()` to call `GameService.MarkGameAsWon()`

## Usage Flow

1. When all waves are completed, `WaveManager.OnAllWavesCompleted()` is called
2. This calls `GameService.MarkGameAsWon()`
3. GameService sets `IsVictory = true` and calls `HudManager.ShowVictoryMessage()`
4. HudManager calls `Hud.ShowVictoryMessage()` which makes the VictoryPanel visible
5. The "You Win! :)" message appears centered on screen

## Visual Design
- **Background**: Semi-transparent dark overlay covering the entire screen
- **Main Text**: "You Win! :)" in yellow, 32pt font, centered
- **Sub Text**: "All enemies defeated!" in green, 16pt font, centered
- **Layout**: Vertically stacked in the center of the screen

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `VictoryMessageTests.cs`
- Tests cover GameService victory state management
- Tests cover HudManager victory message display
- Tests include null safety and error handling

## Reset Behavior
- When the game is reset, the victory state is cleared
- The victory message is hidden
- The game returns to normal state

## Code Quality
- Follows clean code principles with expressive names
- No unnecessary comments (code is self-documenting)
- Proper error handling and null safety
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

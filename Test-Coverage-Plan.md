# Test Coverage Implementation Plan

## Execution Instructions

**Process**: Execute phases one at a time. When a phase is complete:

1. Update this plan file to mark completed items
2. Run `dotnet clean; dotnet build; dotnet test`
3. If all pass, proceed to next phase
4. If warnings or errors occur, fix them before proceeding
5. Continue until all phases are complete

## Overview

This plan implements a streamlined test coverage solution with a **single script** that analyzes all five core modules:

- `src/Application`
- `src/Di`
- `src/Domain`
- `src/Infrastructure`
- `src/Presentation`

**Goal**: Run one command and get a clean summary like:
```
Domain: 90%
Application: 92%
Di: 85%
Infrastructure: 88%
Presentation: 75%
Total: 86%
```

## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup ✅

**Objective**: Establish proper test project structure and dependencies

### Tasks:

- [x] ~~Create test projects for missing modules~~ *Single project structure used*
- [x] ~~Update solution file~~ *Single project structure used*
- [x] ~~Configure project references~~ *Single project structure used*
- [x] Add coverage tooling NuGet packages to test projects:
  - [x] `coverlet.collector`
  - [x] `coverlet.msbuild`
  - [x] `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
  - [x] Test framework packages (xUnit)

**Completed**: Project already has all necessary packages installed.

---

## Phase 2: Coverage Configuration ✅

**Objective**: Configure coverage collection and reporting settings

### Tasks:

- [x] Create `Directory.Build.props` for global coverage settings
- [x] Configure coverage exclusions (auto-generated files, etc.)
- [x] Set up coverage output formats (Cobertura, OpenCover, JSON)
- [x] Configure minimum coverage thresholds per module
- [x] Create `coverlet.runsettings` file for advanced configuration

**Completed**: All coverage configuration files created and properly configured.

---

## Phase 3: Single Coverage Script Implementation ✅

**Objective**: Create one unified script that measures coverage for all modules

### Tasks:

- [x] Create single `test-coverage.sh` (macOS/Linux) script that:
  - [x] Discovers all test projects automatically
  - [x] Maps test projects to their corresponding source modules
  - [x] Runs coverage analysis for each module
  - [x] Calculates and displays per-module percentages
  - [x] Shows overall solution coverage percentage
  - [x] Provides clean, readable output format
- [x] Script should handle:
  - [x] ~~Clean build before coverage analysis~~ *Simplified approach*
  - [x] Error handling for missing test projects
  - [x] Colored output for better readability
  - [x] Optional detailed HTML report generation

**Completed**: Fully functional coverage script with clean output format.

---

## Phase 4: Enhanced Reporting and Validation ✅

**Objective**: Add optional detailed reporting and coverage validation

### Tasks:

- [x] Enhance the script with optional flags:
  - [x] `--detailed` flag for full HTML report generation
  - [x] `--threshold X` flag to fail if coverage below X%
  - [x] `--module MODULE` flag to run coverage for specific module only
  - [x] ~~`--format json|xml|html`~~ *Console format sufficient*
- [x] Add coverage validation features:
  - [x] Configurable minimum coverage thresholds per module
  - [x] Exit codes for CI/CD integration (0=pass, 1=fail)
  - [x] Clear messaging when coverage drops below thresholds

**Completed**: All validation and reporting features implemented.

---

## Phase 5: Integration and Documentation ✅

**Objective**: Integrate coverage into development workflow

### Tasks:

- [x] Create simple `Makefile` with coverage targets:
  - [x] `make coverage` - Run full coverage analysis
  - [x] `make coverage-quick` - Run coverage without HTML reports
  - [x] `make coverage-ci` - Run coverage with CI-friendly output
- [x] Document usage in dedicated guide:
  - [x] How to run coverage analysis
  - [x] How to interpret results
  - [x] How to generate detailed reports
- [x] Create `.gitignore` entries for coverage output files
- [x] Add GitHub Actions workflow example

**Completed**: Full integration with Makefile and comprehensive documentation.

---

## Phase 6: Verification and Documentation ✅

**Objective**: Ensure everything works correctly and is well documented

### Tasks:

- [x] Test all individual module coverage functionality
- [x] Test combined coverage analysis
- [x] Verify coverage reports are accurate and useful
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation covering:
  - [x] How to run coverage for individual modules
  - [x] How to run combined coverage analysis
  - [x] How to interpret coverage reports
  - [x] Coverage thresholds and quality gates
  - [x] Troubleshooting common issues
- [x] ~~Create sample test cases~~ *Using existing tests*
- [x] Performance test coverage analysis

**Completed**: All verification completed and documentation created in `COVERAGE.md`.

---

## Expected Deliverables

### Scripts and Configuration:

1. **Single unified coverage script** (`test-coverage.sh`)
2. Configuration files (Directory.Build.props, coverlet.runsettings)
3. Simple Makefile for easy execution
4. Optional detailed HTML reporting

### Reports and Documentation:

1. **Clean console output** with per-module percentages
2. Optional detailed HTML reports
3. Simple usage documentation
4. Coverage threshold configuration

### Project Structure:

1. Complete test project setup for all 5 modules
2. Proper dependency configuration
3. Coverage tooling integration
4. CI-ready configuration files

---

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] **Single command** shows coverage for all 5 modules in clean format
- [x] Per-module and total coverage percentages displayed clearly
- [x] Script runs on macOS/Linux (primary target)
- [x] Coverage analysis completes quickly (< 2 minutes for full suite)
- [x] Optional detailed reporting available when needed
- [x] Simple integration with development workflow
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass after coverage implementation
- [x] Easy to understand and maintain

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### **Final Result:**
The test coverage system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Run `./test-coverage.sh` or `make coverage` to see clean per-module coverage reporting exactly as requested.

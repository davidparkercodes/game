# Presentation Layer Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Overview
This plan focuses on achieving ~80% test coverage for the Presentation layer by implementing meaningful, UI-focused tests. The emphasis is on testing Godot scene interactions, user input handling, visual components, and presentation logic rather than padding statistics with trivial tests.

## Execution Instructions
**Process**: Execute phases one at a time. When a phase is complete:
1. Update this plan file to mark completed items
2. Run `dotnet clean; dotnet build; dotnet test tests/Presentation`
3. If all pass, proceed to next phase
4. If warnings or errors occur, fix them before proceeding
5. Continue until all phases are complete

## Testing Principles Applied

### User-Centric Testing
- Test from the user's perspective
- Verify visual feedback and responsiveness
- Test complete interaction workflows

### Godot Integration Focus
- Test actual Godot scene behavior
- Verify node tree management
- Test signal system reliability

### Performance Awareness
- Test visual effects impact on performance
- Verify memory cleanup
- Test under realistic load conditions

### Error Handling
- Test missing scene/resource scenarios
- Verify graceful degradation
- Test input validation and sanitization

---

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reliable User Interface**: Well-tested UI components that respond correctly to game state
2. **Smooth Interactions**: Validated input handling and feedback systems
3. **Visual Polish**: Tested visual effects and audio integration
4. **Performance Confidence**: Verified performance characteristics under load
5. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling for missing resources and edge cases

---

## Integration Tests Directory Question

**Recommendation**: Stick with the current structure (`tests/Application`, `tests/Domain`, `tests/Infrastructure`, `tests/Presentation`) rather than adding a separate `tests/Integration` directory.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Clear Layer Ownership**: Each test directory focuses on its specific architectural layer
2. **Integration Within Layers**: Integration tests can live within the appropriate layer (e.g., UI integration tests in `tests/Presentation`)
3. **Cross-Layer Integration**: For tests that span multiple layers, place them in the highest-level layer being tested
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and maintain tests when they're co-located with the code they test

**Alternative Approach**: If you find many cross-layer integration tests, consider adding `tests/EndToEnd` for full application workflow tests, but keep layer-specific integration tests within their respective directories.

---

## Notes
- Focus on testing Godot-specific presentation logic
- Mock infrastructure services where appropriate
- Test actual scene loading and node management
- Verify input handling and user feedback
- Test visual effects without requiring manual verification
- Each phase should be completable independently
- Consider platform-specific testing for input handling

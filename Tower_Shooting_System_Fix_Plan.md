# Tower Shooting System Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis

After the refactor, the tower shooting functionality is completely missing. The towers have all the necessary components in the scene files (Timer, Area2D for enemy detection, BulletScene references) but no actual shooting logic is implemented in the C# code.

**Current State:**

- ‚úÖ Tower base class exists with properties (Range, Damage, FireRate, BulletScene)
- ‚úÖ Timer node exists in tower scenes
- ‚úÖ Area2D node exists for enemy detection
- ‚úÖ Bullet class exists and handles collision/damage
- ‚úÖ Enemy detection logic implemented in towers
- ‚úÖ Target selection logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Projectile firing logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Timer connected to fire events
- ‚úÖ Sound integration completed
- ‚úÖ Tower-specific behaviors implemented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Enemy Detection üéØ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### [x] 1.1 Implement Enemy Detection in Building Base Class

- [x] Connect Area2D signals in `_Ready()` method
- [x] Track enemies entering/exiting tower range
- [x] Maintain list of enemies in range
- [x] Add debug logging for enemy detection

#### [x] 1.2 Implement Target Selection Logic

- [x] Find closest enemy in range
- [x] Prefer enemies closest to path end (if available)
- [x] Handle case when no enemies in range
- [x] Update target when current target dies/leaves range

### Phase 2: Projectile Firing System üî´ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### [x] 2.1 Implement Basic Shooting Logic

- [x] Connect Timer timeout signal to shooting method
- [x] Calculate direction to target enemy
- [x] Instantiate bullet from BulletScene
- [x] Set bullet velocity toward target
- [x] Set bullet damage from tower stats
- [x] Start timer only when enemies are in range

#### [x] 2.2 Implement Sound Integration

- [x] Add shooting sound properties to tower types
- [x] Play appropriate sound when firing (basic_tower_shoot, sniper_tower_shoot)
- [x] Integrate with existing SoundManagerService

#### [x] 2.3 Implement Tower-Specific Behaviors

- [x] BasicTower: Loads stats from config (basic_tower)
- [x] SniperTower: Loads stats from config (sniper_tower)
- [x] Config-driven stats loading (Cost, Damage, Range, FireRate)
- [x] Config-driven sound keys (shoot_sound, impact_sound)
- [x] **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - All stats from data/stats/building_stats.json

#### [x] 2.4 Complete Sound Integration

- [x] Wave/Round start sound - Added to WaveManager.StartNextWave()
- [x] Tower shooting sounds - PlayShootSound() with debug logging
- [x] Bullet impact sounds - Added debug logging to impact detection
- [x] All sounds use existing config keys from data/audio/sound_config.json
- [x] Proper error handling when SoundManagerService unavailable
- [x] **FIXED SOUND SYSTEM** - Replaced stub with real implementation:
  - [x] Implemented proper SoundLoader to load sounds from JSON config
  - [x] Updated SoundManagerService to use real SoundService
  - [x] Added AudioStreamPlayer nodes to scene tree for actual playback
  - [x] Config-driven sound loading from res://data/audio/sound_config.json

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization üé® ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### [x] 3.1 Visual Enhancements

- [x] Rotate tower sprite to face target - Smooth rotation towards enemy
- [x] Enhanced tower behavior - Towers now visually track their targets
- [ ] Add muzzle flash effect when shooting (optional future enhancement)
- [ ] Improve bullet trail/visual effects (optional future enhancement)

#### [x] 3.2 Performance Optimization

- [x] Pool bullet objects to reduce garbage collection - Basic pooling system
- [x] Optimize target selection algorithm - Distance + health priority scoring
- [x] Improved targeting logic - Focus fire on wounded enemies
- [ ] Limit enemy detection frequency (not needed - Area2D signals are efficient)

#### [x] 3.3 Testing & Validation

- [x] System builds without errors (1 minor nullable warning)
- [x] Enhanced visual feedback with tower rotation
- [x] Performance improvements with bullet pooling
- [x] Smarter targeting algorithm for better gameplay

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ ACHIEVED

- [x] Towers automatically detect enemies in range
- [x] Towers fire projectiles at correct intervals
- [x] Projectiles hit enemies and deal appropriate damage
- [x] Different tower types behave distinctly (damage, fire rate, sounds)
- [x] Shooting sounds play correctly for each tower type
- [x] System performs well with multiple towers and enemies
- [x] No errors or crashes during gameplay
- [x] **BONUS**: Towers rotate to face targets for enhanced visual appeal
- [x] **BONUS**: Smart targeting prioritizes wounded enemies
- [x] **BONUS**: Bullet pooling reduces garbage collection

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Files to Modify:

- `src/Presentation/Buildings/Building.cs` - Main shooting logic
- `src/Presentation/Buildings/BasicTower.cs` - Basic tower specifics
- `src/Presentation/Buildings/SniperTower.cs` - Sniper tower specifics
- `src/Presentation/Projectiles/Bullet.cs` - May need minor updates

### Signals to Connect:

- Area2D: `area_entered`, `area_exited` (enemy detection)
- Timer: `timeout` (firing rate control)

### Sound Keys to Use:

- Basic Tower: `"basic_tower_shoot"`
- Sniper Tower: `"sniper_tower_shoot"`
- Bullet Impact: `"basic_bullet_impact"`, `"sniper_bullet_impact"`

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (enemy detection and targeting)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (shooting and sound integration)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours (polish and testing)

**Total**: 5-8 hours

---

## Priority

**HIGH** - Core gameplay functionality that needs to work for the game to be playable.

# GameSimRunner Improvement Plan

## Overview
Improve the GameSimRunner to be a robust, standalone tool for balance testing and level validation without requiring Godot. Currently 16/22 tests pass, with 6 failing tests related to simulation logic issues.

## Execution Instructions
**Process**: Execute phases one at a time. When a phase is complete:
1. Update this plan file to mark completed items
2. Run `dotnet clean; dotnet build; dotnet test`
3. If all pass, proceed to next phase
4. If warnings or errors occur, fix them before proceeding
5. Continue until all phases are complete

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards:
- Follow clean code principles with expressive naming
- Use PascalCase for C# (Ui, Dto, Ai, not UI, DTO, AI)
- No unnecessary comments - code should be self-documenting
- No triple `///` summary comments
- Use `;` instead of `{}` for namespace endings

### Testing Standards:
- All new features must have corresponding tests
- Maintain 100% test pass rate before proceeding to next phase
- Use realistic test data and scenarios
- Include edge case testing
- Implement integration tests for complex features

### Documentation Standards:
- Update this plan file as phases complete
- Document any architectural decisions
- Include usage examples in code
- Maintain clear error messages and logging
- Create user-friendly help documentation

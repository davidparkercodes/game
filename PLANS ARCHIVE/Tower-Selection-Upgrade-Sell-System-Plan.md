## üö® **Risk Mitigation**

### **Potential Issues:**

1. **UI Performance**: Large modal HUD may impact performance
2. **Input Conflicts**: Tower selection vs building placement conflicts
3. **Economic Balance**: Upgrade costs may unbalance gameplay
4. **Visual Clarity**: Selection indicators may be too subtle/obvious
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Touch input considerations for selection

### **Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Performance**: Use object pooling for HUD elements, lazy loading
- **Input**: Clear state machine for input modes, priority system
- **Balance**: Configurable upgrade costs, extensive playtesting
- **Visual**: Multiple visual indicator options, user testing
- **Mobile**: Touch area optimization, touch-friendly UI sizing

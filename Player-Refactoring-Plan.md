### Plan: Refactoring Player.cs

---

## Execution Instructions

**Process**: Execute phases one at a time. When a phase is complete:

1. Update this plan file to mark completed items
2. Run `dotnet clean && dotnet build && dotnet test`
3. If all pass, proceed to next phase
4. If warnings or errors occur, fix them before proceeding
5. Continue until all phases are complete

## ðŸŽ¯  Objective

Simplify the `Player` class by distributing responsibilities to specialized classes, enhancing maintainability and readability.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Movement Logic Refactoring

### **[ ] 1.1 Extract Movement Logic**
- **Refactor**: Confirm that `PlayerMovement.cs` handles all movement-related logic.
- **Enhancements**: Ensure robust handling of input and boundary checks.

### **[ ] 1.2 Validate Boundary Service Integration**
- **Review**: Verify usage in `PlayerMovement.cs`.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Building Interaction Logic

### **[ ] 2.1 Streamline Building Selection**
- **Extract Methods**: Create helper methods/classes for building selection.
- **Purpose**: Reduce direct manipulation in `Player.cs`.

### **[ ] 2.2 Utilize BuildingBuilder Class**
- **Enhance**: Ensure `PlayerBuildingBuilder.cs` efficiently manages building interaction.
- **Adjust**: Remove redundant logic in `Player.cs`.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: HUD Management Separation

### **[ ] 3.1 Refactor HUD Initialization**
- **Transfer Code**: Move HUD-related initialization to a dedicated manager or factory.

### **[ ] 3.2 Refactor HUD Synchronization**
- **Separation**: Handle HUD synchronization in a new class/module.
- **Goal**: Minimize HUD state management in `Player.cs`.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Sound Management Clarification

### **[ ] 4.1 Sound Responsibilities**
- **Clarify**: Ensure sound triggers and management fall under a distinct module/service.
- **Minimize Role**: Reduce sound management responsibilities in `Player.cs`.

### **[ ] 4.2 Implement Sound Service**
- **Objective**: Ensure sound logic (selection, deselection) is modular.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Final Cleanup

### **[ ] 5.1 Code Review**
- **Action**: Conduct a thorough review of remaining `Player.cs` code for further optimizations.

### **[ ] 5.2 Documentation**
- **Document**: Update documentation to reflect new class responsibilities and interactions.

# Enemy Path Visibility Fix Plan

## üõ§Ô∏è **Problem Analysis**

The enemy path system has several critical visibility and rendering issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Path disappears below Level10/GroundLayer** - Z-ordering/layer issues causing path to render behind ground
2. **Path not visible in editor** - Previously worked but now missing in Godot editor view
3. **Path may not be properly configured** - Potential issues with Path2D/PathFollow2D setup
4. **Layer ordering conflicts** - GroundLayer may be masking the path visualization

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Path is clearly visible during gameplay above all ground layers
- [ ] Path is visible and editable in Godot editor
- [ ] Enemies follow the path smoothly without visual glitches
- [ ] Path rendering is consistent across different scenes/levels
- [ ] Path has proper visual styling (color, width, opacity)

---

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Investigation and Diagnosis** üîç

#### **[ ] 1.1 Analyze Current Path Setup**
- [ ] Locate the main Path2D node in the scene hierarchy
- [ ] Check if Path2D is child of Main scene or a sublevel
- [ ] Examine current Z-index/layer settings for path
- [ ] Document current node structure and relationships
- [ ] Take screenshots of current editor view vs expected view

#### **[ ] 1.2 Investigate Layer Configuration**
- [ ] Check Level10/GroundLayer Z-index and CanvasLayer settings
- [ ] Examine all child nodes under GroundLayer for rendering conflicts
- [ ] Review TileMap layer ordering and collision/visibility masks
- [ ] Identify if path is accidentally parented under GroundLayer
- [ ] Document current layer hierarchy and rendering order

#### **[ ] 1.3 Examine Path Component Files**
- [ ] Review `src/Presentation/Components/PathFollower.cs` for any issues
- [ ] Check if PathService is properly configured
- [ ] Examine path-related scene files (`*.tscn`) for corruption
- [ ] Verify Path2D curve configuration and points
- [ ] Test if path exists but is invisible vs actually missing

---

### **Phase 2: Path Visibility Restoration** üëÅÔ∏è

#### **[ ] 2.1 Fix Z-Order and Layer Issues**
- [ ] Move Path2D to appropriate parent node (likely Main scene root)
- [ ] Set proper Z-index to ensure path renders above ground
- [ ] Configure CanvasLayer if needed for consistent ordering
- [ ] Ensure path is not masked by any TileMap or background elements
- [ ] Test visibility at different zoom levels

#### **[ ] 2.2 Restore Editor Visibility**
- [ ] Enable Path2D editor gizmos and curve visibility
- [ ] Check Godot editor view settings (Show/Hide toggles)
- [ ] Verify Path2D node hasn't been accidentally disabled
- [ ] Ensure editor plugins for path editing are enabled
- [ ] Test curve point editing functionality in editor

#### **[ ] 2.3 Enhance Path Visual Styling**
- [ ] Add Line2D child node to Path2D for visible path rendering
- [ ] Configure path color, width, and transparency
- [ ] Add path texture or pattern for better visibility
- [ ] Implement path highlighting during wave preview
- [ ] Ensure path style is consistent with game's visual theme

---

### **Phase 3: Path Functionality Verification** ‚öôÔ∏è

#### **[ ] 3.1 Test Enemy Movement**
- [ ] Spawn test enemies and verify they follow the path correctly
- [ ] Check PathFollower component integration with Path2D
- [ ] Ensure smooth movement without jittering or teleporting
- [ ] Test enemy rotation to face movement direction
- [ ] Verify enemies despawn at path end correctly

#### **[ ] 3.2 Validate Path Configuration**
- [ ] Ensure path has proper start and end points
- [ ] Check path curve smoothness and appropriate difficulty
- [ ] Verify path length provides appropriate game timing
- [ ] Test path works with different enemy types and speeds
- [ ] Ensure path doesn't intersect with building areas inappropriately

#### **[ ] 3.3 Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test path visibility during actual wave gameplay
- [ ] Verify path doesn't interfere with building placement UI
- [ ] Check path performance with multiple enemies
- [ ] Ensure path rendering doesn't affect game performance
- [ ] Test path behavior when changing scenes or reloading

---

### **Phase 4: Polish and Optimization** ‚ú®

#### **[ ] 4.1 Visual Enhancements**
- [ ] Add animated path elements (flowing particles, arrows)
- [ ] Implement path preview during wave countdown
- [ ] Add visual indicators for path start/end points
- [ ] Consider adding path waypoint markers
- [ ] Implement path visibility toggle for players (optional)

#### **[ ] 4.2 Editor Improvements**
- [ ] Create custom editor tools for path editing
- [ ] Add validation for path configuration
- [ ] Implement path testing tools in editor
- [ ] Create documentation for path setup process
- [ ] Add path templates for different level layouts

#### **[ ] 4.3 Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Optimize path rendering for multiple simultaneous enemies
- [ ] Implement path curve caching for performance
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary path calculations
- [ ] Profile path-related performance impact
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for path data

## üîß **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Key Files to Examine:**
- `scenes/Core/Main.tscn` - Main scene hierarchy
- `scenes/Levels/Level10.tscn` - Level-specific configuration
- `src/Presentation/Components/PathFollower.cs` - Path movement logic
- `src/Infrastructure/Game/Services/PathService.cs` - Path management service
- Any Path2D scene files in `scenes/` directory

### **Likely Root Causes:**
1. **Z-Index Conflict**: Path2D Z-index is lower than GroundLayer
2. **Parent Node Issue**: Path moved under wrong parent (like GroundLayer)
3. **Editor Settings**: Path visibility accidentally disabled in editor
4. **Scene Corruption**: Path2D node or curve data corrupted
5. **Canvas Layer Issue**: Incorrect CanvasLayer setup affecting rendering order

### **Quick Diagnostics to Try:**
```gdscript
# In editor console or debug script:
# Check if Path2D exists
get_node("Path2D")  
# Check Z-index
get_node("Path2D").z_index
# Check visibility
get_node("Path2D").visible
# Check curve points
get_node("Path2D").curve.point_count
```

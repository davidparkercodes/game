## Execution Instructions

**Process**: Execute phases one at a time. When a phase is complete:

1. Update this plan file to mark completed items
2. Run `dotnet clean && dotnet build && dotnet test`
3. If all pass, proceed to next phase
4. If warnings or errors occur, fix them before proceeding
5. Continue until all phases are complete

- [ ] Review current `PathManager` (`src/Application/Enemies/Services/PathManager.cs`) interface and implementation
- [ ] Study `PathService` (`src/Infrastructure/Enemies/Services/PathService.cs`) hardcoded path points
- [ ] Examine `GodotPathManager` (`src/Infrastructure/Enemies/GodotPathManager.cs`) visualization system
- [ ] Analyze `LevelDataResource` structure (`data/levels/level_01.tres`) for path storage

- [ ] Specify integration points with existing `IPathManager` interface
- [ ] Document seed-based generation for reproducible paths

### **[ ] 1.3 Choose Generation Algorithm**

## üö® **Risk Mitigation**

### **Potential Issues:**
1. **Impossible Path Scenarios**: Mitigated by A* fallback and multiple retry attempts
2. **Performance Impact**: Addressed through profiling and optimization in Phase 5
3. **Game Balance**: Controlled through configurable parameters and playtesting
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained through versioning and gradual migration
5. **Visual Inconsistency**: Prevented through comprehensive rendering tests

### **Fallback Strategies:**
- Revert to static paths if generation fails repeatedly
- Provide manual path editing tools for impossible scenarios
- Include curated "good" paths as generation starting points
- Allow mixing static and generated path elements
